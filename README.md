## Schedule a mock interview session with me
<strong>[Click here to book a 1hr session](https://calendly.com/leestanleysg/mock-interviews?back=1&month=2021-07)</strong>

I'll be doing mock interview sessions throughout Summer and Fall! Last season I did ~25 mock interviews covering product design, execution, estimation, etc. Experience with mock interviewing is preferred, but not required. If you'd like to just ask me some questions about product management and exploring career paths, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leestanleysg/) and shoot me a message.   
```
1. 5min: Casual Intro 
2. 20min: Question(s) (Specify in the Calendly form which kind of questions you'd like)
3. 5 min: Feedback
4. 25min: Switch sides, you ask me & give feedback
5. 5min: Casual Outro
```
